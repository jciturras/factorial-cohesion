 - 100% Efficient design can be made with the MktEx macro.
 - Saturated Design - The smallest design that can be made.
   Note that the saturated design is not one of the       
   recommended designs for this problem.  It is shown     
   to provide some context for the recommended sizes.

%mktblock(data=Randomized, nblocks=10, seed=2624)
/* 10 decks, 4 decks with 15 vignettes and 6 decks with 14 vignettes  */
```

# Generation of the vignettes

- First we load the file containing the vignette information generated in SAS.

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=F}
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman") # instalar pacman
pacman::p_load(readxl,dplyr,knitr,kableExtra)

df_vig <- xlsx::read.xlsx(file = "../input/vignetas.xlsx",sheetIndex = 1)

colnames = c("obs","deck","vig","gender", "age", "migration", "religion", "education", "employment_status", "income", "political_orientation", "cultural_values")
names(df_vig) <- colnames
names(df_vig)
vig_dat<- df_vig %>% mutate(deck_vig=paste0(deck,vig)) %>% select(obs,deck,vig,deck_vig,everything())
```
- Save the vignette information for later use in the analysis.

```{r,warning=FALSE}
save(vig_dat,file = here::here("input/data/proc/vig_dim.RData"))
```


## Labels

-  level labelling for text generation

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=F}
df_vig <- 
df_vig %>% 
    mutate(
      gender = recode(gender, `1` = "Jan", `2` = "Sophia"),
      age = recode(
        age,
        `1` = "is 35 years old.",
        `2` = "is 45 years old.",
        `3` = "is 65 years old."
      ),
      migration  = recode(
        migration,
        `1` = "SUS was born in Germany",
        `2` = "SUS was born in Germany, comes from a Turkish family",
        `3` = "SUS was born in Syria"
      ),
      religion = recode(
        religion,
        `1` = "and goes to the parish every Sunday.",
        `2` = "and goes to the moske every Friday.",
        `3` = "and goes to the synagogue every Saturday.",
        `4` = "and does not profess any religion."
      ),
      education  = recode(
        education,
        `1` = "Also, SUB holds a primary school diploma,",
        `2` = "Also, SUB holds a secondary school diploma,",

      ),

        `2` = "receives a monthly income of 2400€ after taxes",
        `3` = "receives a monthly income of 3700€ after taxes",
      ),
      employment_status = recode(
        employment_status,
        `1` = "and has a full-time job.",
        `2` = "and is unemployed.",
        `3` = "and is a homemaker."
      ),
      political_orientation = recode(
        political_orientation,
        `1` = "SUS defines PRON as a left-wing person that ",
        `2` = "SUS defines PRON as a politically moderate person that",
        `3` = "SUS defines PRON as a right-wing person that",
        `4` = "SUS is not interested in politics and"
      ),
      cultural_values = recode(
        cultural_values,
        `1` = "values the importance of being be tolerant and to help people around GENDER3",
        `2` = "values the importance of feeling safe, to fit in with others and to respect traditions.",
        `3` = "values the importance of reaching personal achievements and to be in charge",
        `4` = "values the importance of making GENDER3 own decisions, and to live a fun and adventurous life."
      )      
    )

```

## Text generation
